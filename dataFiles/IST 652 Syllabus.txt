Course Description: 
Scripting for data analysis. Acquiring, accessing and transforming data in the forms of 
structured, semi-structured and unstructured data
Additional Course Description: 
The goal of this class is to teach students the tools and skills of scripting needed to 
solve problems related to the access and preparation of data in a variety of formats 
and situations, sometimes known as data wrangling. The scripting techniques learned 
will provide the skills needed to structure data science pipelines, from acquiring and 
cleaning data to accessing and transforming data for analysis or visualization. 
The main content focus will be on information access and processing tasks on 
structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. For these three types of data, the 
course will include the use of structured numeric and text data such as that from a 
spread sheets or databases, the use of data obtained through standard data 
exchange formats such as HTML or XML from web pages or JSON from web-based 
APIs, and the use of data obtained by pattern matching from text or log files. The skills 
learned in this class are intended to complement the analytical and visualization skills 
learned in other data science courses. Python will be mainly used and taught 
throughout the course’s activities, but it will be assumed that students already have a 
programming background, either through course work or through online study. 
Prerequisite / Co-requisite: 
Although no specific course is required, some programming knowledge will be 
assumed. This may be acquired through courses or online resources 
Audience:  
Students of the Master’s Degree program on Information Management and the 
Master’s Degree program on Applied Data Science are the primary audience for this 
course. Students in other graduate degree programs may enroll with permission of the 
instructor.

Learning Objectives:
After taking this course, the students will be able to: 
 Write scripts to access and amass information from files of structured data, access 
files in semi-structured data and to define and find patterns in unstructured data. 
 Prepare and transform data to produce data summaries, lists, and networks. 
 Analyze and solve data access problems for the three types of data and to find and 
deploy appropriate software packages that can be integrated into the problem 
solution. 
 Frame real world data questions and show how they can be answered with data. 
Texts / Supplies – Required: 
 Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition (ISBN-13: 978-1491957660) 
Texts / Supplies– Additional: 
 Data Wrangling with Python: Tips and Tools to Make Your Life Easier (ISBN-13: 
978-1491948811) 
Course Requirements and Expectations: 
 Homework assignments will be used to re-enforce and evaluate understanding 
and development of concepts covered in one or two weeks of content.  
 After midterms week, students will propose a term project or select from a list 
provided by the instructor. The instructor must approve the topic/project if 
proposed by students. The project must involve the development of scripts to 
achieve a particular data analysis goal or achieve a particular 
transformation/visualization of the data in a large dataset. The students will 
prepare a 10 to 20 page project report and deliver a 10 to 15 minute presentation 
summarizing the project at the end of the semester. 
o Groups of 2 to 4 people will work as a team on a final project depending 
on the size of the dataset and project objectives. Further details about 
the project will be provided as the semester progresses.  
General Requirement for Assignment Submissions 
Assignment submission documents must be professionally prepared with computer 
applications. Unless otherwise stated, documents must be submitted electronically to 
Blackboard. No hand-written documents/solutions will be accepted. An assignment 
submission must be in one document when it is submitted to Blackboard. If you have 
additional supporting materials that are in physical forms or hard copies (e.g., business 
forms or some images), you must scan them into JPG or TIFF format and embed them 
into your MS Word or PDF document. If you use MS Word to prepare your 
assignments, use Times New Roman style with 12-pt font, 1.5 line spacing, and 1 inch 
margins. COURSE SYLLABUS

For each assignment, be sure to include the following information in its first page: 
 Course number (i.e. IST 652) 
 Name(s) of the author(s) or the team members 
 Name of the assignment (e.g. “Homework 2”) 
 Date the assignment is due and date in which it is submitted 
You must submit all assignments to the professor in class on the deadline 
specified for each assignment. If you are late, I will deduct 10% of the original 
grade for the first day of lateness plus 15% for every subsequent day . You will 
not receive full credit for topics/assignments presented in an unprofessional manner. 
Professionalism includes the proper use of grammar, punctuation, and limiting spelling 
mistakes. Professionalism also means adhering to given instructions. Failure to 
adhere to the assignment instructions will result in a reduction of the grade. If English 
is not your first language set up an appointment with the writing program so they can 
help you improve your writing. 
How to Succeed in This Course: 
Keep pace with the content of the course. It is expected that you will spend 6 to 9 hours 
outside of class time covering the material, the readings and executing labs / homework 
and project assignments.
Mental health and overall well-being are significant predictors of academic success. As 
such it is essential that during your college experience you develop the skills and 
resources to effectively navigate stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health 
concerns. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the Barnes Center 
provides ( https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/ ) and seek out support for mental health concerns 
as needed. Counseling services are available 24/7, 365 days, at 315-443-8000. I 
encourage you to explore the resources available through the Wellness Leadership 
Institute, https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/wellness-leadership-institute/ .
Grading: 
All exams and assignments will be graded in a 0-100 point scale. The weight

Syracuse University Policies:  
Syracuse University has a variety of policies designed to guarantee that students live 
and study in a community respectful of their needs and those of fellow students.  The 
policies and services are listed on the new Syracuse University Senate approved 
syllabus appendix titled, ‘Syracuse University Student Policies and Services’.   
These statements are an official part of this course syllabus. 
Course specific policies 
Attendance 
In addition to the university’s attendance policy, please note that attendance will be taken 
throughout the semester in both labs and lectures. If you arrive late or leave early, you 
will be marked absent. There are no excused absences unless documented by the 
university. If you have 2 or more absences, your final grade will be dropped one level 
down the grade scale. (A- is lowered to B+, C+ becomes a C, etc.) 
Use of Class Materials and Recordings: 
Original class materials (handouts, assignments, tests, etc.) and recordings of class 
sessions are the intellectual property of the course instructor. You may download these 
materials for your use in this class. However, you may not provide these materials to 
other parties (e.g., web sites, social media, other students) without permission. Doing so 
is a violation of intellectual property law and of the student code of conduct. 
Educational Use of Student Work 
Student work prepared for University courses in any media may be used for educational 
purposes, if the course syllabus makes clear that such use may occur. You grant 
permission to have your work used in this manner by registering for, and by continuing COURSE SYLLABUS

to be enrolled in, courses where such use of student work is announced in the course 
syllabus. 
I intend to use academic work that you complete this semester in subsequent 
semesters for educational purposes. Before using your work for that purpose, I will 
either get your written permission or render the work anonymous by removing all your 
personal identification.
