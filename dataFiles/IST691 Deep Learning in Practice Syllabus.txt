Assignment Weight (%) Learning Objectives Quizzes (4) 24 2 HW (4) 44 2, 3 Group Project 32 1, 2, 3, 4  NOTES: • Homework assignments: Assignments must be professionally prepared and submitted electronically to the LMS. All assignments should be submitted as Jupyter notebook files.  • Group Project: The objective of the project is to work as a team to apply concepts taught in this class to solve a data analytics problem.   Grading: For this class, an "A" would mean the student has the capability to independently solve a simple data analytics task. Below is the formula for number-to-letter grade conversion.  Grade Points Grade Points Grade Points Grade Points   B+ 87-89 C+ 77-79 F 0-69 A 93-100 B 83-86 C 73-76   A- 90-92 B- 80-82 C- 70-72   Grades of D and D- may not be assigned to graduate students.  Course Specific Policies on attendance, late work, make up work, examinations if outside normal class time, etc.: • Registration: Students must register prior to the first class or may be restricted from registering. If you are registered but not present at the first class, you run the risk of being administratively deregistered from this course so that your seat can be given to a student on the wait list. • Late Policy for Assignments: To ensure fast return, all assignments should be submitted on time. One-hour grace period is given to accommodate any incidents around deadline. Late policy will be enforced starting from the second hour. You are free to discuss the assignments with your classmates, but you must write up the report all by yourself. Plagiarism cases will be reported to the university. • Communications: This course will use Blackboard as the main communication platforms for class exercises and notifications. Students are required to check their Blackboard accounts on a regular basis.

The policies and services are listed on the new Syracuse University Senate approved syllabus appendix titled, ‘Syracuse University Student Policies and Services’.   These statements are an official part of this course syllabus.      University Attendance Policy Attendance in classes is expected in all courses at Syracuse University. Students are expected to arrive on campus in time to attend the first meeting of all classes for which they are registered.  Students who do not attend classes starting with the first scheduled meeting may be academically withdrawn as not making progress toward degree by failure to attend. Instructors set course-specific policies for absences from scheduled class meetings in their syllabi.   It is a federal requirement that students who do not attend or cease to attend a class to be reported at the time of determination by the faculty. Faculty should use “ESPR” and “MSPR” in Orange Success to alert the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Aid.  A grade of NA is posted to any student for whom the Never Attended flag is raised in Orange SUccess. More information regarding Orange SUccess can be found here, at http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/.  Students should also review the University’s religious observance policy and make the required arrangements at the beginning of each semester.  Diversity and Disability  (ensuring that students are aware of their rights and responsibilities in a diverse, inclusive, accessible, bias-free campus community) can be found here, at: https://www.syracuse.edu/life/accessibilitydiversity/.  Religious Observances Notification and Policy  (steps to follow to request accommodations for the observance of religious holidays) can be found here, at: http://supolicies.syr.edu/studs/religious_observance.htm  Orange SUccess  (tools to access a variety of SU resources, including ways to communicate with advisors and faculty members) can be found here, at:  http://orangesuccess.syr.edu/getting-started-2/  Disability-Related Accommodations Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation.  There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course.  I invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process. COURSE SYLLABUS IST 691: Deep Learning in Practice      If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, please visit Center for Disability Resources. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityresources@syr.edu for more detailed information.  CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and generally are not provided retroactively, please contact CDR as soon as possible to begin this process. https://disabilityresources.syr.edu/   Academic Integrity Policy Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. SU students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check-in on MySlice.   Course	Evaluations At the end of the term, the iSchool will ask you to share course feedback through EvaluationKIT [https://coursefeedback.syr.edu]. Log in to EvaluationKIT using your NetID and password. Please take the time to share your feedback about this course and your experience in it; all ratings and comments are completely anonymous.  The iSchool carefully reviews your feedback. Our instructors use this feedback to fine tune course delivery and instruction; our professors of record use this feedback to fine tune course content and assignments. All feedback is factored into iSchool decisions about course, program and instructor development.  Use of Blackboard This course involves the use of Syracuse University’s Blackboard system as an online tool. The environment is composed of a number of elements that will help you be successful in both your current coursework and your lifelong learning opportunities.
